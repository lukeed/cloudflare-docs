# Rules

You can check for an existing root ruleset from the dashboard or via the [Account rulesets API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-rulesets-properties). If you are a new Magic Transit customer, you may not have a root ruleset created for your account.

To view examples for root rulesets, review the the [Magic Firewall Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/magic_firewall_ruleset).

## Add a rule

4.  Fill out the information for your new rule.
5.  When you are done, click **Add new rule**.

## Update a rule

1.  From your dashboard, click **Firewall Rulesets**.
2.  Click **Magic Firewall**. A list of firewall rules displays.
3.  Locate the rule you want to edit and click **Edit**.
4.  Update the rule with your changes and click **Edit rule**.

## Delete an existing rule

1.  Locate the rule you'd like to delete in the list.
2.  From the end of the row, click **Delete**.
