# Configure tunnels

`cloudflared` uses a configuration file to determine how it proxies traffic to services. This section covers:

*   A list of general-purpose [configuration keys](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/config/) and their descriptions
*   An explanation of the [Ingress Rules](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ingress/) which map incoming traffic to applications running on your origin
